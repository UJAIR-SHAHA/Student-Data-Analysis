# Student Data Preprocessing and Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves the preprocessing of student data using Python and Excel, followed by the creation of an interactive dashboard using Power BI Desktop. The Excel sheet contains detailed information about students, and the preprocessing steps aim to clean and organize the data for effective visualization.

## Project Structure

- **`Data/`**: Not Shared Due to privacy Concern
- **`Dashboard/`**: Stores the Power BI DashBoard in pdf format.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Python Script:**
   - Utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
   - Handles missing values, duplicates, and any outliers.
   - Applies necessary transformations for enhanced analysis.

2. **Excel Sheet:**
   - Serves as the initial dataset for preprocessing.
   - Contains columns such as student name, age, grades, etc.

## Power BI Dashboard

1. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Utilizes Power BI Desktop for building interactive visualizations.
   - Connects to the preprocessed data for real-time updates.
   - Incorporates visuals like charts, graphs, and tables for a comprehensive overview.

2. **Visual Components:**
   - Student demographics summary.
   - Grade distribution and performance analysis.
   - Dynamic filters for personalized exploration.

3. **Interactivity:**
   - Users can explore and filter data based on various parameters.
   - Drill-through functionality for detailed insights.
   - Responsive design for seamless user experience.

## Dependencies

- Python (3.6 and above)
- Pandas library
- Power BI Desktop

## Additional Notes

- The project is designed to provide a user-friendly and insightful dashboard  to analyze student data efficiently.
